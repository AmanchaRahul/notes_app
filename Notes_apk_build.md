Notes App Development & APK Build Process

Project Overview

This project is a Notes App that allows users to:

Write, edit, and delete notes

Capture images and insert them into notes

Upload images and insert them into notes

Authenticate via login and signup

Use voice input for notes

Development Approach

To ensure a smooth development and debugging process, the app will be built incrementally. Each major feature will be implemented and tested separately before integrating everything into a full-fledged APK.

Incremental Build & Testing Plan

Step 1: Basic Note Functionality

Implement adding, editing, and deleting text notes.

Test core CRUD operations.

Build APK and test on real devices.

Step 2: Image Capture & Integration

Implement camera functionality to capture images.

Allow users to insert captured images into notes.

Ensure proper storage and retrieval of images.

Build APK and test.

Step 3: Uploading Images & Integration

Implement image selection from gallery.

Allow users to upload images into notes.

Ensure correct file handling.

Build APK and test.

Step 4: User Authentication

Implement login and signup functionality.

Use supabase authentication provider.

Ensure session handling works properly.

Build APK and test.

Step 5: Voice Input Feature

Implement speech-to-text functionality.

Allow users to dictate notes via voice input.

Ensure smooth UI/UX for this feature.

Build APK and test.

Automated Build Trigger with Cursor AI

To ensure Cursor AI builds the APK automatically whenever a new component is added:

Monitor changes: Detect when a new feature is merged into the main branch.

Run eas build command: Trigger the APK build process.

Deployment & Testing: Deploy the APK for testing.

Build Command (for Cursor AI)

eas build -p android

Final Full-Fledged APK

Once all components are integrated and tested individually, the final APK will be built with:

eas build -p android --profile production

Conclusion

This document ensures a structured development process, preventing complex errors when integrating multiple features. Cursor AI will continuously build the APK as each feature is added, making debugging easier and more efficient.
